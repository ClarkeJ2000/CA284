1) ask user for input(numbers only)
2) set max and min of input to 999 and -999
3) store it in a variable eg. Num
4) check each part of input using a for loop
5) check lenght of input using strlen()
6) whatever the lenght is divide by sutible number. eg if input == 4000, we divide by 1000.
Store this in new variable eg. answer
7) Move onto next number and do the same as step 6
8) continue to do step 6 until you ar left with 0
9)when 0 is encountered, print "zero" and end program using a return 0; statement
